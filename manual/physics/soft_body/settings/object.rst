Friction
   The friction of the surrounding medium. Generally friction dampens a movement.
   The larger the friction, the more viscous is the medium.
   Friction always appears when a vertex moves relative to its surround medium.

Mass
   Mass value for vertices.
   Larger mass slows down acceleration, except for gravity where the motion is constant regardless of mass.
   Larger mass means larger inertia, so also braking a soft body is more difficult.

Control Point
   You can paint weights and use a specified vertex group for mass values.
