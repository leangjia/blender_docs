Mass
   Specifies how heavy the object is and "weights" irrespective of gravity.
   There are predefined mass preset available with *Calculate Mass*
   in the :menuselection:`Object --> Rigid Body` menu.

   Calculate Mass
      Automatically calculate mass values for rigid body objects based on its volume.
      There are many useful presets available from the menu, listing real-world objects.

      .. note::

         Also you can have *Custom* mass material type,
         which is achieved by setting a custom density value (kg/m\ :sup:`3`).

Dynamic
   Enables/disables rigid body simulation for object.

Animated
   Allows the rigid body additionally to be controlled by the animation system.
