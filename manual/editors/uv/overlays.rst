Overlays
********

The Overlays pop-over configures the overlays that are displayed on top of images.
In the header, there is a button to turn off all overlays for the UV Editor.
This option also toggles the visibility of :doc:`/modeling/meshes/uv/workflows/udims` tile information.
The options that are visible in the pop-over depend on the UV Editor mode.
