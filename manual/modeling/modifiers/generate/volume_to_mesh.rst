***********************
Volume to Mesh Modifier
***********************

This modifier is the inverse of the *Mesh to Volume* modifier.
It takes an existing volume object and converts one of its grids to a mesh.
Only scalar grids (such as the density grid) can be converted.

.. tip::

   To copy and move the generated mesh separately from the volume object,
   use a :doc:`collection instance </scene_layout/object/properties/instancing/collection>`.

   The Volume to Mesh modifier.

Object
   The source volume object.

Grid Name
   The name of the grid that will be converted.
   This has to be a scalar grid.

Resolution Mode
   Mode for how the resolution of the final mesh is controlled.

   Grid
      This makes the resolution depended on the resolution of the grid that is converted.
      Higher resolution grids result in a higher resolution mesh.
      In many cases, that is the most efficient mode.

   Voxel Amount
      Specifies the approximate resolution of the final mesh.
      The voxel size is adapted to the size of the entire volume.

   Voxel Size
      Use a fixed resolution that does not change when the volume changes.

Threshold
   Voxels with a larger value are considered to be inside the mesh and all other voxels outside.
   The mesh will be generated on the boundary of inside and outside voxels.
   This is sometimes also called the "iso value".

Adaptivity
   This is similar to decimating the final to reduce resolution where it is not needed.

Smooth Shading
   Enables smooth shading on the generated mesh.
