Pose as Rest Pose
   Conversely, you may define the current pose as the new rest pose
   (i.e. "apply" current transformations to the *Edit Mode*),
   When you do so, the skinned objects/geometry is **also** reset to its default,
   undeformed state, which generally means you will have to skin it again.
Pose Selected as Rest Pose
   Same as *Pose as Rest Pose* but only applies to selected bones.
Visual Transform to Pose

Assign Custom Property Values as Default
