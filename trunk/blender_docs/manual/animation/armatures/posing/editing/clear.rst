   :Mode:      Pose Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Pose --> Clear Transform`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Alt-G`, :kbd:`Alt-R`, :kbd:`Alt-S`

Once you have transformed some bones, if you want to return to their rest position,
just clear their transformations.

Location, Rotation, Scale :kbd:`Alt-G`, :kbd:`Alt-R`, :kbd:`Alt-S`
   Clears individual transforms.
All
   To clear everything at once.
Reset Unkeyed
   Clears the transforms to their keyframe state.

   Only Selected
      Operate on just the selected or all bones.

Note that in *Envelope* visualization, :kbd:`Alt-S` does not clear the scale,
but rather scales the *Distance* influence area of the selected bones
(also available through the :menuselection:`Pose --> Scale Envelope Distance` menu entry,
which is only effective in *Envelope* visualization, even though it is always available...).
