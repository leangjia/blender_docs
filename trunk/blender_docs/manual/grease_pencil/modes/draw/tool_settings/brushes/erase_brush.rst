Erase Brush

Erase brushes are the special types of brushes that uses Grease Pencil for *Erase* tools.
The brush can be changed in the Tool Settings.

Soft and hard eraser brushes are settings variations of the same *Erase Brush*.
You can create many brushes, each with unique settings to get different effects while erasing.

The *Erase Brush* has also other two special eraser types: point and stroke.
