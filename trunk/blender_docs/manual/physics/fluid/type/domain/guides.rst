Fluid guides are used to apply forces onto the simulation. They are similar to simple external forces but in addition seek
to preserve the physically accurate flow of the fluid. The *Guides* panel allows the user to adjust guiding forces globally,
i.e. for the entire domain. Enabling the guides notifies the fluid solver to use the more accurate, but also computationally
more expensive pressure solving step.

.. note::

   Even when there are no guiding objects baked or there is no guiding domain attached, the fluid solver will still perform
   the more expensive pressure guiding algorithm if guiding is enabled.

Weight
   Controls the lag of the guiding. A larger value (also known as the *alpha* guiding value) results in a greater lag. 

Size
   This parameter determines the size of the vortices that the guiding produces. A greater guiding size (also known as
   the blur radius or *beta* guiding value) results in larger vortices.

Velocity Factor
   All guiding velocities are multiplied by this factor. That is, every cell of the guiding grid, which has the same size
   as the domain object, is multiplied by this factor. 

Velocity Source
   Guiding velocities can either come from objects that move inside the domain or from other fluid domains. Former need
   to be declared as fluid *Effector* objects and baked, usually after animating them by hand. Latter can be selected
   with the selection tool but need to be baked already.

   Once effector objects have been baked it is not possible to change the fluid domain resolution anymore. When using
   another fluid domain as the guiding source, this domain can have a different resolution and may also be of a different
   type (e.g. the guiding domain is of type *Gas* while the actual domain with the guiding effect in it is of type *Liquid*).

Guide parent
   When using *Domain* as the velocity source, this field serves to select the guiding domain object.
