Adding noise to the gas simulation creates a finer detailed looking simulation
while using a relatively low *Resolution Divisions*. This allows animators to quickly set up
a low resolution simulation and later add details without changing the overall fluid motion.

.. note::

   Fluid noise is an implementation of

Smoke Noise vs. High Resolution Divisions
=========================================

*Upres Factor* and *Resolution Divisions* are not equivalent.
By using different combinations of these resolution settings, you can get a variety of different styles of smoke.

   Comparison between a domain with 24 *Resolution Divisions* and 4 *Upres Factor* (left),
   and a domain with 100 *Resolution Divisions* and 1 *Upres Factor* division (right).

Low division simulations with lots of *Upres Factor* divisions generally appear
smaller in real-world scale, with many smaller details (larger flames, etc.).
They can be used to create pyroclastic plumes such as in the following image:
