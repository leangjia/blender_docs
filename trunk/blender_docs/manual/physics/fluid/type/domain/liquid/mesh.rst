Todo.

Use Speed Vectors
   If this button is clicked, no speed vectors will be exported.
   So by default, speed vectors are generated and stored on disk.
   They can be used to compute image-based motion blur with the compositing nodes.

Bake Mesh, Free Mesh
   Todo.

   After a domain has been baked, it changes to the liquid mesh.
   To reselect the domain so that you can bake it again after you have made changes,
   go to any frame and select :kbd:`RMB` the fluid mesh.
   Then you can click the *bake* button again to recompute the fluid flows inside that domain.
