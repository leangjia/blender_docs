Bake Mesh, Free Mesh
   Todo.

   After a domain has been baked, it changes to the liquid mesh.
   To reselect the domain so that you can bake it again after you have made changes,
   go to any frame and select :kbd:`RMB` the fluid mesh.
   Then you can click the *bake* button again to recompute the fluid flows inside that domain.
