Draw
====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Draw`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`X`

Moves vertices inward or outward,
based the average normal of the vertices contained within the drawn brush stroke.


Draw Sharp
==========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Draw Sharp`

Similar to the *Draw* brush however, it deforms the mesh from the original coordinates
and uses the *Sharper* :doc:`Falloff </sculpt_paint/brush/falloff>`.
This is useful for creating cloth wrinkles, stylized hair or hard surface edges.


Clay
====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Clay`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`C`

Similar to the *Draw* brush, but includes settings to adjust the plane on which the brush acts.
It behaves like a combination of the *Flatten* and *Draw* brushes.


.. _bpy.types.Brush.tip_roundness:

Clay Strips
===========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Clay Strips`

Similar to the *Clay* brush, but it uses a cube to define the brush area of influence rather than a sphere.

Tip Roundness
   Factor to control how round the brush is, a value of zero will make the brush square.
   Note, the :doc:`Brush Falloff </sculpt_paint/brush/falloff>`
   is only applied to the rounded portions of the brush.


Layer
=====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Layer`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`L`

This brush is similar to *Draw*, except that the height of the displacement layer is capped.
This creates the appearance of a solid layer being drawn.
This brush does not draw on top of itself; a brush stroke intersects itself.
Releasing the mouse button and starting a new stroke
will reset the depth and paint on top of the previous stroke.

Persistent
   You can keep sculpting on the same layer between strokes when this is on.
Set Persistent Base
   This button resets the base so that you can add another layer.


Inflate
=======

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Inflate`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`I`

Similar to *Draw*,
except that vertices in *Inflate* mode are displaced in the direction of their own normals.


Blob
====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Blob`

Pushes mesh outward or inward into a spherical shape with settings to
control the amount of magnification at the edge of the sphere.


Crease
======

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Crease`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Shift-C`

Creates sharp indents or ridges by pushing or pulling the mesh, while pinching the vertices together.


Smooth
======

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Smooth`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`S`

Eliminates irregularities in the area of the mesh within the brush's
influence by smoothing the positions of the vertices.


Flatten
=======

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Flatten`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Shift-T`

The *Flatten* brush determines an "area plane"
located by default at the average height above/below the vertices within the brush area.
The vertices are then pulled towards this plane.
The inverse of the *Flatten* brush is the *Contrast* brush
which pushes vertices up or down away from the brush plane.


Fill
====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Fill`

Works like the Flatten brush, but only brings vertices below the brush plane upwards.

Area Radius
   Ratio between the brush radius and the radius that is going to be used to sample the area center.

Invert to Scrape
   When enabled, holding :kbd:`Ctrl` while sculpting
   changes the brush behavior to be the same as the *Scrape* brush.
   When disabled, holding :kbd:`Ctrl` while sculpting,
   will push vertices below the cursor downward.


Scrape
======

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Scrape`

The *Scrape* brush works like the *Flatten* brush, but only brings vertices above the plane downwards.

Area Radius
   Ratio between the brush radius and the radius that is going to be used to sample the area center.

Invert to Fill
   When enabled, holding :kbd:`Ctrl` while sculpting
   changes the brush behavior to be the same as the *Fill* brush.
   When disabled, holding :kbd:`Ctrl` while sculpting,
   will push vertices above the cursor up away from the cursor.


Multiplane Scrape
=================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Multiplane Scrape`

Scrapes the mesh with two angled planes at the same time, producing a sharp edge between them.
This is useful for creating edges when sculpting hard surface objects.

Plane Angle
   The angle between the two planes of the brush, pressing :kbd:`Ctrl` inverts the angle.

Dynamic Mode
   When enabled, the base angle is sampled from the mesh surface.
   The *Plane Angle* controls how much the angle will increase when applying pen pressure.
   When pressing :kbd:`Ctrl`, it locks the plane angle to 0 degrees.

Show Cursor Preview
   Displays a preview of the two scrape planes
   and the angle they form instead of the cursor while performing the stroke.


Pinch
=====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Pinch`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`P`

Pulls vertices towards the center of the brush.
The inverse setting is *Magnify*, in which vertices are pushed away from the center of the brush.


Grab
====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Grab`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`G`

Used to drag a group of vertices around. *Grab* selects a group of vertices on mouse-down,
and pulls them to follow the mouse. And unlike other brushes,
*Grab* does not move different vertices as the brush is dragged across the model.
The effect is like moving a group of vertices in Edit Mode with Proportional Editing enabled,
except that *Grab* can make use of other Sculpt Mode options (like textures and symmetry).

Grab Active Vertex
   Snaps the maximum strength of the brush to the highlighted active vertex,
   making it easier to manipulate low poly models or meshes with subdivision surfaces.

   Enabling *Grab Active Vertex* also enables a dynamic mesh preview which
   generates a preview of vertices connected to the active vertex.
   This helps to visualize the real geometry that is being manipulating while sculpting with active modifiers.


Elastic Deform
==============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Elastic Deform`

Used to simulate realistic deformations such as grabbing or twisting of :term:`elastic` objects.
For example, this tool works great for modeling the shape of flesh like objects such as humans or animals.
When pressing :kbd:`Ctrl`, the brush deforms vertices along the normal of the active vertex.

Deformation
   The surface alteration that is used in the brush.

   Grab
      Used to drag a group of vertices around.
   Bi-scale Grab
      Like *Grab* but the falloff is more localized to the center of the brush.
   Tri-scale Grab
      Like *Bi-scale Grab* but the falloff is more localized to the center of the brush.
   Scale
      Displaces vertices away from the active vertex.
   Twist
      Vertices are rotated around the active vertex.

Volume Preservation
   Poisson ratio for elastic deformation.
   Higher values preserve volume more, but also lead to more bulging.


Snake Hook
==========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Snake Hook`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`K`

Pulls vertices along with the movement of the brush to create long, snake-like forms.

Magnify
   The *Snake Hook* brush tends to loose volume along the stroke,
   with *Magnify* value greater than 0.5 it's possible to sculpt shapes without loosing volume.
Rake
   A factor to support moving the mesh with rotation following the cursor's motion.


Thumb
=====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Thumb`

Similar to the *Nudge* brush, this one flattens the mesh in the brush area,
while moving it in the direction of the brush stroke.


Pose
====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Pose`

This brush is used to pose a model simulating an armature-like deformation.
The pivot point for rotation is calculated automatically based
on the radius of the brush and the topology of the model.
When pressing :kbd:`Ctrl`, the pose brush applies a twist rotation
to the posing segments instead of using the rotation or an IK deformation.
The falloff of the rotation across multiple segments is controlled by the brush falloff curve.

Pose Origin Offset
   Offset of the pose origin in relation to the brush radius.
   This is useful to manipulate areas with a lot of complex shapes like fingers.
Smooth Iterations
   Controls the smoothness of the falloff of the deformation.
Pose IK Segments
   Controls how many :ref:`IK bones <bone-constraints-inverse-kinematics>`
   are going to be created for posing.


Nudge
=====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Nudge`

Moves vertices in the direction of the brush stroke.


Rotate
======

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Rotate`

Rotates vertices within the brush in the direction the cursor is moved. The initial drag direction
is the zero angle and by rotating around the center you can create a vortex effect.


Slide Relax
===========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Slide Relax`

This brush slides the topology of the mesh in the direction of the stroke
without changing the geometrical shape of the mesh.
When pressing :kbd:`Shift`, the brush enters *Relax* mode
which tries to create an even distribution of quads without deforming the volume of the mesh.


Simplify
========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Simplify`

This brush collapses short edges (as defined by the detail size) whether or
not the *Collapse Short Edges* option is enabled.
This brush has no effect if dynamic topology is not enabled.


Mask
====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Mask`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`M`

Lets you select mesh parts to be unaffected by other brushes by painting vertex colors.
The mask values are shown as gray-scale.
I.e. the darker a masked area is, the less effect sculpting on it will have.
See also the options of the :ref:`sculpt-mask-menu` menu.

Mask Tool
   The mask brush has two modes:

   Draw
      Mask drawing.
   Smooth :kbd:`Shift`
      Pressing :kbd:`Shift` with the mask brush active will toggle the mask smoothing mode.


Mesh Filter
===========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Sculpt Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Mesh Filter`

Applies a deformation to all vertices in the mesh at the same time.
To use this tool, simply click and drag away from the object to have a positive effect
and click and drag towards the mesh to have a negative effect.

Filter Type
   Smooth
      Eliminates irregularities of the mesh by making the positions of the vertices more uniform.
      This filter works similar to the *Smooth Brush*.
   Scale
      Increases the size of the mesh.
      This filter works similar to the :ref:`Scale Transform <bpy.ops.transform.resize>`.
   Inflate
      Displaces vertices uniformly along their normal.
      This filter works similar to the *Inflate Brush*.
   Sphere
      Morphs the mesh progressively into a sphere.
      This filter works similar to the :ref:`To Sphere Transform <bpy.ops.transform.tosphere>`.
   Random
      Randomly moves vertices along the vertex normal.
      This filter works similar to the :ref:`Randomize Transform <bpy.ops.object.randomize_transform>`.
   Relax
      Tries to create an even distribution of quads without deforming the volume of the mesh.
      This filter works the same as the *Relax* mode of the *Slide Relax* brush.
Strength
   The amount of effect the filter has on the mesh.
Deformation Axis
   Apply the deformation only on the selected axis.
