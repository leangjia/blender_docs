   :align: right

Draw
   Moves vertices inward or outward based on the average normal.

Draw Sharp
   Move vertices inward or outward based the original coordinates
   and uses the *Sharper* :doc:`Falloff </sculpt_paint/brush/falloff>`.

Clay
   Similar to the *Draw* brush, but includes settings to adjust the plane on which the brush acts.

Clay Strips
   The same as the *Clay* brush, but it uses a cube to define the brush area of influence rather than a sphere.

Layer
   Moves all vertices an exact height creating a flat layer.

Inflate
   Displaces the mesh in the direction of the vertex normals.

Blob
   Pushes mesh outward or inward into a spherical shape.

Crease
   Creates sharp indents or ridges by pushing or pulling the mesh, while pinching the vertices together.

Smooth
   Eliminates irregularities in the mesh by averaging the positions of the vertices.

Flatten
   Smooths vertices to a flay plain by finding an average height and moves vertices towards that height.

Fill
   Brings vertices below the brush plane upwards.

Scrape
   Brings vertices above the plane downwards.

Multiplane Scrape
   Scrapes the mesh with two angled planes at the same time, producing a sharp edge between them.

Pinch :kbd:`P`
   Pulls vertices towards the center of the brush.

Grab
   Selects a group of vertices and pulls them to follow the mouse.

Elastic Deform
   Used to simulate realistic deformations such as grabbing or twisting of :term:`elastic` objects.

Snake Hook :kbd:`K`
   Pulls vertices along with the movement of the brush to create long, snake-like forms.

Thumb
   Flattens the mesh in the brush area, while moving it in the direction of the brush stroke.

Pose
   This brush is used to pose a model simulating an armature-like deformation.

Nudge
   Moves vertices in the direction of the brush stroke.

Rotate
   Rotates vertices within the brush in the direction the cursor is moved.

Slide Relax
   This brush slides the topology of the mesh in the direction of the stroke
   without changing the geometrical shape of the mesh.

Simplify
   Cleans up geometry by collapsing short edges.

Mask
   Lets you select mesh parts to be unaffected by other brushes by painting vertex colors.

Mesh Filter
   Applies a deformation to all vertices in the mesh at the same time.

Move
   Translation tool.

Rotate
   Rotation tool.

Scale
   Scale tool.

Transform
   Tool to adjust the objects translation, rotations and scale.

:ref:`Annotate <tool-annotate>`
   Draw free-hand annotation.

   Annotate Line
      Draw straight line annotation.
   Annotate Polygon
      Draw a polygon annotation.
   Annotate Eraser
      Erase previous drawn annotations.
